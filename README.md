This repository contains examples that have been used to write articles
in the [GitHub Pages](https://michaelkpfeifer.github.io/) repository.

It is organized in directories and each directory corresponds to an article.
There is no direct link between articles and directories but the names
of articles and directories should make it easy to figure out which directory
belongs to which article.

Note that Clojure code is often located in a directory named
`clojurex` because the Leiningen tool does not allow the creation of
projects named `clojure`.
